I am wondering if I should change from having almost every word in the ProseMirror editor be a mark and instead use decorations which should also be able to store the same kind of information. That might make LLM integration be easier. This is my current schema:

Document Structure

  The editor uses TipTap (which wraps ProseMirror) with the following extensions:

  Nodes (Block-level elements):

  1. Document - Root node (from TipTap core)

    - The top-level container for all content

  2. Speaker - Custom block node

    - Group: block

    - Content: inline\* (can contain any inline content)

    - Attributes:

        - data-name: Speaker's name

      - id: Unique identifier

      - topic: Associated topic

    - Renders as a custom Svelte component (Segment.svelte)

    - Represents a speaker's segment in the transcript

  3. Diff - Custom inline node

    - Group: inline

    - Properties: inline: true, atom: true, selectable: true

    - Attributes:

        - id: Unique diff identifier

      - originalText: The original text being replaced

      - suggestedText: The suggested replacement

      - changeType: Type of change

      - confidence: Confidence level (0-1)

      - context: Additional context

      - status: Current status (pending/accepted/rejected)

    - Represents a suggested text change/correction

  Marks (Inline formatting):

  1. Text - Basic text node (from TipTap core)

  2. TextStyle - Text styling (from TipTap)

  3. Word - Custom mark for individual words

    - Priority: 1000

    - Attributes:

        - start: Start time (for audio synchronization)

      - end: End time

      - id: Unique word identifier

      - lang: Language code (default: "et" for Estonian)

      - spellcheck: Spellcheck flag

    - Used for word-level timing and tracking in transcripts

  Additional Extensions:

  - History - Undo/redo functionality

  - DropCursor - Visual indicator for drag-and-drop

  - GapCursor - Cursor for navigating between nodes

  - WordColor - Custom plugin for word coloring

  - Annotation - Custom plugin for annotations

  Schema Hierarchy:

  Document

  ├── Speaker (block)

  │   ├── Text (with Word marks)

  │   └── Diff (inline, atomic)

  └── Text nodes

  Key Features:

  - Speaker-based structure: The transcript is organized by speaker segments

  - Word-level timing: Each word can have timing information for audio sync

  - Diff tracking: Inline diff nodes for tracking suggested changes

  - Atomic diff nodes: Diffs are atomic (indivisible) and can be accepted/rejected as units

  This schema is specifically designed for transcript editing with:

  - Speaker identification and segmentation

  - Word-level audio synchronization

  - Change tracking and suggestion management

  - Support for multiple languages (Estonian focus)

  The schema allows for complex operations like position-based text replacement while maintaining the semantic structure

  of speaker segments and preserving word-level timing information.

Show thinking
Yes, you are right to question your current schema. Switching from using a Word mark for almost every word to another approach is a very good idea, especially for improving performance and simplifying LLM integration.

Your current schema is powerful for data association but creates significant overhead. The best solution is likely not to use decorations, but to change the Word from a mark into its own inline node.

Let's break down the pros and cons of each approach.

1. Current Approach: "Word as a Mark"
   This is the schema you currently have. While it ensures data is tied to the text, it has major drawbacks.

Pros:

Data (start, end, id) is fundamentally part of the document, so it's included in the undo/redo history and is always saved with the content.

Cons:

Performance Issues: This is the biggest problem. Applying a unique mark to almost every word creates thousands of virtual nodes. Every small edit can cause ProseMirror to do a lot of work re-evaluating and re-rendering these marks, which can make the editor feel sluggish, especially with long transcripts.

Transaction Complexity: Simple user actions, like typing a space in the middle of a word, become programmatically complex. You would need custom logic to split the original Word mark into two new ones, create a new ID, and recalculate timings. This is very difficult to manage correctly.

Difficult LLM Integration: When you serialize this document to JSON for an LLM, the payload becomes enormous and deeply nested. It's a very unnatural structure for an LLM to parse and edit, making your prompts more complex and the results more error-prone.

2. Proposed Approach: "Word as a Decoration"
   In this model, the document would contain only plain text. The timing and word data would be stored in a separate data structure outside of ProseMirror (e.g., in an array). A custom plugin would then read this data and generate Decoration.inline() on the fly to highlight words.

Pros:

Excellent Performance: The underlying ProseMirror document is just simple, clean text, which is extremely fast to render and update. Decorations are highly optimized for this kind of non-document overlay.

Easy LLM Integration: You can send clean, simple text to the LLM. The LLM's task is much easier, and the payloads are small. This is a huge advantage.

Cons:

Data Synchronization is Your Responsibility: This is the critical drawback. If a user edits the text, your external array of word data immediately becomes out of sync. You would need to build a complex system using ProseMirror's Mapping functionality to listen for every change and meticulously update your external data store. This is a very difficult problem to solve robustly.

Not Part of Document History: Since the data is external, it is not part of the undo/redo stack. You would have to implement your own logic to keep the two histories synchronized.

3. Recommended Alternative: "Word as an Inline Node"
   This approach correctly models your data by treating each word with associated metadata as a distinct structural unit within the document.

Your schema would change from Speaker containing Text to Speaker containing many WordNodes.

JavaScript

// A new inline node for your schema
const WordNode = Node.create({
name: 'word',
group: 'inline',
content: 'text\*', // Contains the text of the word
inline: true,
attrs: {
start: {default: null},
end: {default: null},
id: {default: null},
lang: {default: 'et'},
// ... any other attributes
},
// ... toDOM, parseDOM definitions
});
Pros:

Structurally Sound (Best of Both Worlds): Like marks, the data is part of the document, so it's saved correctly and works flawlessly with undo/redo. But like decorations, it treats words as distinct objects, which is much cleaner than overlapping marks.

Good Performance: This is generally much more performant than the mark-heavy approach. ProseMirror is better at managing a series of distinct inline nodes than it is at managing thousands of marks on a single large text node.

Simplified Transformations: When a user types, you're now dealing with operations on nodes (like splitting a WordNode or merging two), which is a much clearer and more manageable problem in ProseMirror than managing mark boundaries.

Excellent for LLM Integration: When you serialize this to JSON, you get a clean array of word objects: [ { "type": "word", "attrs": {...}, "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello"}] }, ... ]. This is an ideal structure for an LLM. It can easily understand the concept of a word as an object and can be instructed to return edits that modify specific word nodes or replace a sequence of them.

Cons:

Editing Experience Requires Thought: You need to decide if a WordNode should be atom: true. If it's atomic, users can't place the cursor inside a word; they can only select the word as a whole. This is simpler to implement but might feel restrictive. If it's not atomic, you need to write commands to handle the user experience of editing inside a word (e.g., how to handle splitting it).

Recommendation
You should change from your current mark-based approach.

The "Word as an Inline Node" approach is the most robust, professional, and balanced solution. It correctly models your domain, provides good performance, and creates a structure that is ideal for high-quality LLM integration. While it requires some initial thought on the schema and editing experience, it will save you from the significant performance and complexity issues you will inevitably face with your current implementation.
