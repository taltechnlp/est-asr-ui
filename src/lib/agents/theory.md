# Architecting an Advanced Agentic Framework for Scientific ASR Post-Editing

## A Scientific Framework for Agentic ASR Correction

The pursuit of perfect Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has shifted from a singular focus on improving core recognizer accuracy to a dual approach that includes sophisticated post-processing. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology for this second stage, known as Error Correction (EC).¹ However, applying LLMs as simple text-based proofreaders fails to address the fundamental nature of ASR errors and can introduce new problems. A more robust, scientifically grounded paradigm is required—one that equips an agentic LLM not merely with linguistic knowledge, but with a suite of multi-modal analysis tools. This report outlines a comprehensive architecture for such a system, moving beyond text-only correction to a paradigm of "grounded refinement," where an agentic framework actively verifies and refines transcriptions by cross-referencing acoustic, phonetic, structural, and domain-specific evidence. This approach transforms the LLM from a simple corrector into a forensic analyst, capable of reasoning about the likely causes of transcription errors and proposing high-confidence corrections.

## The Limitations of Text-Only Correction

While LLMs excel at tasks requiring deep linguistic understanding, their application to ASR error correction is fraught with challenges when constrained to text-only inputs. The primary issue is that ASR errors are not random typographical mistakes; they are often acoustically motivated substitutions of phonetically similar words or phrases.² An erroneous transcription can be grammatically correct and semantically plausible, giving a text-only LLM no signal that a correction is needed. For example, the substitution of "prototype" with "protocol" may create a perfectly valid sentence that an LLM would leave untouched, despite it being a misrepresentation of the spoken utterance.

This leads to two significant failure modes. The first is the failure to correct valid but incorrect text. The second, and more pernicious, is "over-correction" or hallucination.¹ Lacking grounding in the source audio, an LLM may "correct" a perfectly accurate but perhaps awkward or disfluent phrase into something more polished, thereby altering the original meaning. This is a known issue where the free-generation paradigm of LLMs clashes with the minimum-change principle required for effective error correction.⁴ This discrepancy contributes to the "ASR-NLP gap," a phenomenon where NLP models, including LLMs, that demonstrate high performance on clean, written text experience a significant degradation when applied to the noisy, disfluent, and error-prone output of ASR systems.³ The unique statistical patterns of ASR errors—such as the higher error rates for named entities, technical jargon, and words spoken by non-native speakers—are not fully captured by models trained on general web text.³

## The Multi-Modal Correction Paradigm

To transcend the limitations of text-only approaches, a paradigm shift is necessary. The agentic framework must be empowered to reason over a richer set of inputs that provide evidence from modalities beyond the transcribed text. This multi-modal correction paradigm is founded on equipping the agent with tools that deliver signals from three distinct categories of information:

**Acoustic and Phonetic Information**: This includes data about the underlying sound patterns of the speech. Tools in this category can convert text to phonetic representations to check for acoustic similarity between a transcribed word and a potential correction. They can also analyze the quality of the audio signal itself, providing crucial context about the likelihood of errors in a given segment. This allows the agent to address the root cause of many ASR errors: phonetic ambiguity.⁵

**Linguistic and Structural Information**: This involves a deeper analysis of the grammatical and syntactic structure of the transcribed text. While LLMs have an implicit understanding of grammar, specialized tools like dependency parsers or grammatical error detectors can provide explicit, structured outputs that highlight anomalies. ASR errors often create subtle syntactic breaks or illogical grammatical relationships that these tools can flag, providing a strong, independent signal of a potential transcription error.⁸

**Contextual and Domain-Specific Information**: This category focuses on grounding the transcription in the specific knowledge domain of the conversation. This goes far beyond a simple web search for entities. It includes leveraging structured knowledge graphs, dynamic glossaries of technical terms, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that provide the agent with examples of similar errors and their corrections from a curated knowledge base.¹⁰

This multi-modal approach is particularly vital when dealing with "black-box" ASR systems, where access to internal model weights or decoding lattices is not possible.¹² In such scenarios, non-intrusive post-processing is the only available method for improvement, making a rich, multi-modal toolkit indispensable.

## The Agentic Workflow

An agentic workflow is a system in which an LLM-powered agent does more than execute a predefined sequence of steps. It actively plans, selects, and uses tools, analyzes their outputs, and iteratively refines its approach to achieve a complex goal.¹⁴ This stands in contrast to a simple, linear pipeline. The objective is to move from a static process to a dynamic one where the agent's actions are contingent on the data it observes.

For ASR post-editing, this means replacing a fixed summarize → analyze → correct sequence with a more flexible loop. For a given segment of the transcript, the agent might first perform a quick linguistic check. If no anomalies are found and the audio quality is high, it may move on. However, if the grammatical analysis flags an issue, or if the audio quality is poor, the agent might then decide to invoke a phonetic analyzer, query a knowledge graph, and retrieve similar examples before proposing a correction. This iterative, self-correcting process, where the output of one tool informs the decision to use another, is the hallmark of a truly agentic system.¹⁶ This approach allows the system to allocate computational resources intelligently, performing deep analysis only on segments that are likely to contain errors, while efficiently processing high-quality portions of the transcript.

The transition from a basic text-correction system to a scientifically grounded, multi-modal framework represents a significant leap in capability. This evolution is not merely about adding more tools, but about fundamentally changing the nature of the task from simple proofreading to evidence-based refinement. The following table illustrates this conceptual evolution, mapping the components of a basic system to their advanced, scientifically validated counterparts that form the basis of this report.

| Current Tool/Concept | Proposed Advanced Tool(s) | Underlying Scientific Principle | Expected Impact |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Single ASR Hypothesis | N-Best List Rescoring & Constrained Decoding | Leveraging ASR beam search outputs to manage uncertainty and prevent LLM hallucination.¹³ | Reduces over-correction and ensures corrections are acoustically plausible. |
| Second ASR Model | Phonetic & Acoustic Analysis Suite (Phonetic Encoder, Signal Quality Assessor) | Grounding corrections in the audio signal itself, addressing the phonetic root of many ASR errors.⁵ | Corrects homophone and phonetically similar word errors impossible to detect from text alone. |
| Web Search for Entities | Knowledge Integration Suite (Dynamic Glossary, KG Query Engine, GEC-RAG) | Integrating structured, domain-specific knowledge and example-based retrieval to handle specialized language.¹⁰ | Drastically reduces Entity Error Rate (EER) for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and domain-specific terms. |
| General NLP/LLM | Advanced Linguistic Analysis Suite (Grammatical Anomaly Detector, Dependency Parser) | Using syntactic and grammatical anomalies as high-confidence signals of underlying ASR transcription errors.⁸ | Identifies subtle errors by detecting their structural impact on the sentence, improving precision. |## Advanced Hypothesis Generation and Selection Tools

The user's current approach of using a second ASR system provides a single alternative hypothesis. However, modern ASR systems, during their decoding process, generate a multitude of potential transcriptions, typically ranked by probability. This collection of top candidates, known as an N-best list, is a rich source of information that is often discarded when only the single best (1-best) hypothesis is returned. By equipping the agentic LLM with tools to access and reason over this N-best list, its ability to identify and correct errors can be significantly enhanced. These tools provide a scientifically robust method for managing the ASR model's uncertainty and, crucially, for constraining the LLM's powerful but sometimes unbridled generative capabilities.

### The Scientific Rationale for N-Best Analysis

The core principle behind using N-best lists is that the 1-best hypothesis, while being the most probable according to the ASR model's scoring, is not always the most accurate. The true, correct transcription frequently exists as a lower-ranked candidate within the top N hypotheses (where N is typically 5, 10, or more).¹³ The N-best list, therefore, represents the ASR model's "solution space" for a given audio segment.

Furthermore, the variation among the hypotheses in the N-best list is a powerful signal of uncertainty. If the top several hypotheses are nearly identical, the ASR model is highly confident. Conversely, if the top hypotheses diverge significantly, particularly around a specific word or phrase, it indicates a point of acoustic or linguistic ambiguity where an error is highly likely.²⁰ For an agentic corrector, this divergence serves as a natural flag, pointing directly to the segments that require the most scrutiny. This information is far more valuable than a simple confidence score, as it provides concrete alternative readings that are known to be acoustically plausible.### Tool 1: N-Best List Rescoring and Selection Agent

The most direct application of N-best lists is in a rescoring framework. While the ASR system ranks hypotheses based on a combination of its internal acoustic and language models, a powerful external LLM often possesses a superior and more context-aware language model.

**Functionality**: This tool provides the agent with the N-best list of transcriptions for a given audio segment. The agent's task is to re-rank these hypotheses and select the one that is most plausible. This process leverages the LLM's advanced understanding of grammar, fluency, and, most importantly, long-range contextual coherence derived from the summary of the entire conversation.¹⁷

**Agentic Use Case**: Upon receiving an N-best list for a segment, the Orchestrator Agent would task a specialized agent with this tool. The agent would be prompted to act as an expert editor, evaluating each of the N hypotheses against several criteria:

- **Linguistic Quality**: Is the sentence grammatically correct and fluent?
- **Contextual Coherence**: Does the hypothesis make sense given the preceding dialogue and the overall topic of the conversation (as established by the summary)?
- **Domain Relevance**: Does the hypothesis use terminology consistent with the domain (e.g., medical, technical)?

The agent would then output its chosen best hypothesis from the list. This technique is highly effective because it constrains the agent to select from a set of acoustically validated candidates, dramatically reducing the risk of hallucination while leveraging the LLM's superior linguistic judgment.²²### Tool 2: Constrained Decoding Integration

While rescoring is powerful, it is limited to selecting one of the existing N hypotheses. A more advanced technique, constrained decoding, uses the information from the N-best list to guide the LLM's generative process, allowing it to construct a new, corrected sentence that is a hybrid of the most plausible parts of several hypotheses.

**Functionality**: This tool provides a mechanism to restrict the LLM's output vocabulary to only those words or sub-words that appear in the N-best list or a more complex structure derived from it, such as a word lattice.¹³ A word lattice is a graph representation of all possible paths the ASR decoder considered, making it an even richer source of information than a simple N-best list.

**Agentic Use Case**: This tool is invoked when rescoring fails to produce a satisfactory hypothesis (i.e., all N candidates contain apparent errors). The agent would first use the N-best list to construct a finite-state automaton or a prefix tree that represents all possible word sequences. The LLM's decoding process is then constrained to only generate tokens that follow a valid path in this structure.

This approach represents a sophisticated fusion of ASR and LLM capabilities. It uses the ASR model's acoustic analysis to define a "probabilistic boundary" of what could have been said. The LLM's role is then to find the most linguistically and contextually coherent path within that boundary. This directly mitigates the risk of the LLM generating words that are phonetically unrelated to the source audio, effectively grounding its output in the ASR's acoustic analysis.¹³ This reframes the correction task from the open-ended "fix this sentence" to the much more constrained and reliable "find the best path through this solution space." It is the ultimate safeguard against factual hallucination in ASR post-editing.## Phonetic and Acoustic Analysis Toolkit

To address the core nature of ASR errors, an agentic framework must be capable of reasoning about the audio signal itself. Text-level analysis is blind to the phonetic ambiguities that cause a recognizer to mistake one word for another. By equipping the agent with tools to analyze phonetic representations and assess audio quality, we can ground its error correction process in the physical evidence of the speech signal. This enables the agent to solve a class of errors that are fundamentally inaccessible through linguistic analysis alone, moving the system from plausible correction to scientifically informed refinement.

### The Primacy of Phonetics in ASR Errors

A significant portion of ASR errors are not random but are systematic results of phonetic similarity. These errors fall into several key categories:

- **Homophones**: Words with identical pronunciation but different spelling and meaning (e.g., "there," "their," "they're"; "to," "too," "two") are a classic challenge. Context is the only disambiguating factor, and if the ASR's language model makes a mistake, a text-only corrector may not see a reason to intervene.⁷

- **Phonetically Similar Words**: This is a broader category of errors where words share a large number of phonemes or have a similar acoustic signature (e.g., "recognize speech" vs. "wreck a nice beach"). These substitutions can sometimes result in nonsensical phrases, but often produce plausible but incorrect sentences.²

- **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Named Entities**: When an ASR system encounters a proper noun or technical term not in its vocabulary, it often defaults to a phonetic "best guess" transcription using known words. For example, the name "Siobhan" might be transcribed as "shev aun".³

In all these cases, the erroneous text can be grammatically and semantically valid, rendering text-only correction methods ineffective. The only way to reliably detect and correct these errors is to compare the phonetic representation of the transcribed word with that of a suspected correction.### Tool 3: Phonetic Encoder and Similarity Analyzer

This tool provides the agent with the fundamental ability to reason about the sound of words, independent of their spelling.

**Functionality**: The tool should offer two core functions. First, given a word or phrase, it returns a standardized phonetic representation, such as the ARPAbet used by the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. For example, `phonetic_encode("protocol")` would return `P R OW T AH K AA L`. Second, given two phonetic strings, it computes a similarity score between them, for instance, using a phonetic edit distance algorithm that accounts for the similarity of different phonemes.⁵

**Agentic Use Case**: This tool becomes invaluable when the agent suspects a specific word is incorrect, perhaps due to a low confidence score from the ASR, a contextual anomaly, or a flag from the linguistic analysis tools. The agent can first generate a list of plausible alternative words based on context. It then uses the Phonetic Analyzer to compare each candidate to the originally transcribed word.

For example, if the transcript reads, "We need to review the new company protocol," but the context suggests a product is being discussed, the agent might hypothesize the word should be "prototype."

1. Agent identifies "protocol" as a potential error.
2. Agent generates "prototype" as a candidate correction based on contextual clues.
3. Agent calls `phonetic_encode("protocol")` → `P R OW T AH K AA L`
4. Agent calls `phonetic_encode("prototype")` → `P R OW T AH T AY P`
5. Agent calls `phonetic_similarity("P R OW T AH K AA L", "P R OW T AH T AY P")` → High similarity score.

This high phonetic similarity provides strong, independent evidence that "prototype" is a plausible ASR error for "protocol," giving the agent high confidence in making the correction.⁷ This is particularly effective for correcting named entities, where phonetic guesswork is the primary source of error.⁵### Tool 4: Signal Quality Assessor

Not all audio is created equal. Background noise, microphone quality, and speaker distance all affect the clarity of the audio signal, which in turn directly impacts ASR accuracy. An intelligent agent should be aware of the quality of the evidence it is working with.

**Functionality**: This tool takes an audio segment, identified by its timestamps in the full audio file, as input. It then computes one or more metrics of audio quality, with the most critical being the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). A high SNR indicates a clear signal with little background noise, while a low SNR indicates the speech is obscured by noise.²⁷

**Agentic Use Case**: The agent can use the SNR metric as a dynamic parameter to guide its entire correction strategy for a given segment. Research has established a direct correlation between low SNR and high Word Error Rate (WER).¹⁸ However, ASR confidence scores alone can be an unreliable trigger for correction, as a model can be highly confident in an incorrect transcription.³⁰

By combining these two signals, the agent can create a much more nuanced and effective trigger mechanism. It can establish a dynamic confidence threshold for intervention that is modulated by the SNR. For a segment with a very high SNR (e.g., >30dB), the agent should be very conservative and only intervene if ASR confidence is extremely low, as errors are less likely. For a segment with a low SNR (e.g., <15dB), the agent should be more aggressive, lowering its confidence threshold for intervention because errors are much more probable. This allows the agent to adapt its behavior to the quality of the source audio, avoiding over-correction on clean speech while more effectively catching errors in noisy segments.### Tool 5: Speaker Diarization Contextualizer

In conversations with multiple participants, correctly attributing speech to the right speaker is a critical component of an accurate transcript. Errors in speaker diarization—the process of determining "who spoke when"—are a common problem.

**Functionality**: This tool takes an audio segment and its corresponding transcript as input and returns a version of the transcript where each word or phrase is tagged with a speaker label (e.g., "Speaker 1," "Speaker 2").³¹

**Agentic Use Case**: The agent can leverage speaker information in several ways. First, it can be used to resolve contextual ambiguity. If the agent is trying to decide between two possible corrections, knowing which speaker uttered the phrase can be a deciding factor, as different speakers may have different idiolects, vocabularies, or roles in the conversation. Second, the agent can use this tool to directly correct diarization errors. An LLM fine-tuned on diarization correction tasks can identify and fix segments where the speaker labels are likely incorrect, for example, by recognizing that a sentence fragment is a direct response to the previous speaker's question and should be attributed to the other participant.³² This makes the diarization tool not just a source of context, but an active component of the correction process itself.## Contextual and Domain-Knowledge Integration Tools

One of the most significant challenges for general-purpose ASR systems is their performance degradation in specialized domains. Conversations in fields like medicine, finance, or engineering are replete with technical terminology, acronyms, and specific named entities that are unlikely to be well-represented in the ASR model's general training data. These out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or low-frequency terms are a primary source of high-impact errors.⁵ To overcome this, the agentic framework must be equipped with tools that can infuse it with deep, dynamic, and domain-specific knowledge, transforming it from a generalist into a temporary expert for the duration of a given conversation.

### The Challenge of Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) and Domain-Specific Language

ASR models operate based on a predefined vocabulary and a language model that encodes statistical relationships between words. When a speaker uses a word not in this vocabulary (an OOV term), the system is forced to transcribe it as a sequence of known words that sound similar, leading to errors.³ Even for words that are in the vocabulary but are rare in general language (e.g., a specific drug name), the language model may assign them a low probability, favoring a more common but incorrect alternative. The user's current tool, a web search for entities, is a step in the right direction, but it is a blunt instrument. It relies on unstructured data and lacks the precision and reliability required for high-stakes applications. A more scientific approach involves integrating structured and curated knowledge sources directly into the agent's workflow.### Tool 6: Dynamic Glossary and Vocabulary Manager

This tool provides a direct and powerful mechanism for on-the-fly domain adaptation. It allows the agent to programmatically inform the ASR and correction process about key terms relevant to the current conversation.

**Functionality**: This tool should be an API-driven service for managing custom vocabularies or glossaries. It needs to support several key operations:

- **Add Term**: Add a specific word or phrase (e.g., "convolutional neural network," "aneurysm") to a temporary, session-specific glossary.
- **Boost Term**: Assign a positive weight or "boost" to a term, signaling that it is highly likely to appear. This can influence a second-pass ASR or a rescoring model to favor this term.³⁴
- **Define Replacement**: Create rules to automatically replace a common spoken form with a desired written form (e.g., "C-N-N" → "CNN").
- **Block Term**: Specify words that should be actively avoided, which is useful for preventing common, contextually inappropriate substitutions.³⁴

**Agentic Use Case**: This tool enables a proactive, two-phase correction process. In the first phase, "Knowledge Acquisition," the agent analyzes the initial summary of the conversation. It extracts key entities, acronyms, and potential jargon. It can use its other tools, like the web search or KG Query Engine, to find the correct spellings and definitions of these terms. It then programmatically populates a new glossary for this specific session using the Dynamic Glossary Manager. In the second phase, "Grounded Correction," when analyzing individual segments, the agent can consult this glossary to validate terms or propose corrections for OOV words. For instance, if the ASR transcribes a medical term as "an your ism," the agent can find a close match in its dynamically created glossary and confidently correct it to "aneurysm."### Tool 7: Knowledge Graph (KG) Query Engine

Knowledge graphs like DBpedia, Wikidata, or custom-built domain-specific KGs, store factual information as a network of entities and their relationships. This structured format allows for much more precise and reliable querying than a general web search.

**Functionality**: This tool provides the agent with an interface to execute structured queries against a knowledge graph. For a public KG like DBpedia, this would typically be a SPARQL endpoint. The agent should be able to query for entity attributes (e.g., "What is the instance_of property for 'NVIDIA'?") and relationships between entities (e.g., "Does 'Jensen Huang' have a founder_of relationship with 'NVIDIA'?").¹¹

**Agentic Use Case**: The KG Query Engine serves as the agent's fact-checker. When an entity or a factual claim is mentioned in the transcript, the agent can verify its plausibility against the structured knowledge in the KG. For example, if a transcript says, "The presentation on quantum computing by Microsoft's CEO, Tim Cook," the agent can perform the following checks:

1. Identify entities: "Microsoft," "CEO," "Tim Cook."
2. Query KG: `SELECT ?ceo WHERE { dbr:Microsoft dbo:chiefExecutiveOfficer ?ceo. }` → Returns "Satya Nadella."
3. Query KG: `SELECT ?company WHERE { dbr:Tim_Cook dbo:chiefExecutiveOfficer ?company. }` → Returns "Apple Inc."

The agent now has definitive evidence of a contradiction. It can flag this as a potential high-impact error, which could be a mis-transcription of the name or the company, or a speaker error. This allows the agent to move beyond simple spelling to verifying the semantic and factual integrity of the transcript.### Tool 8: Retrieval-Augmented Correction (GEC-RAG)

This is arguably the most advanced and powerful tool for domain-specific error correction. It is based on the principle that the most effective way to teach an LLM how to correct errors from a specific ASR system is to show it relevant examples.

**Functionality**: The GEC-RAG (Generative Error Correction via Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool combines a retriever and a generator. The system is built upon a knowledge base of high-quality data pairs: (`erroneous_ASR_hypothesis`, `correct_ground_truth_transcription`). When the agent provides a new erroneous segment to the tool, the retriever uses a lexical similarity search (e.g., TF-IDF or other sparse vector methods) to find the most similar ASR hypotheses from the knowledge base.¹⁰ These retrieved pairs are then formatted as few-shot examples and prepended to the prompt for the LLM generator, which then produces the corrected output.²⁰

**Agentic Use Case**: This tool is particularly effective for systematic errors characteristic of a specific ASR model or domain. For example, if an ASR system consistently mis-transcribes a particular technical term in the same way, the knowledge base will contain examples of this pattern. When a new instance of this error occurs, the G-RAG tool will retrieve these exact examples, showing the LLM precisely how to fix it. Research has demonstrated that this approach can yield dramatic reductions in WER, with improvements of up to 82% reported in some low-resource contexts.¹⁰ The performance is highly dependent on the size and relevance of the knowledge base, with larger and more domain-specific knowledge bases leading to significantly better results. For a production system, this knowledge base can be continuously expanded with corrected transcripts, creating a powerful feedback loop where the system learns from its own corrected history.## Advanced Linguistic and Structural Analysis Tools

While semantic coherence and contextual plausibility are strong indicators of a correct transcription, ASR errors also leave behind distinct structural and grammatical fingerprints. An erroneous word substitution, insertion, or deletion can disrupt the syntactic integrity of a sentence, creating anomalies that are detectable even if the sentence remains superficially understandable. By equipping the agent with tools designed to perform deep linguistic analysis, we provide it with a set of orthogonal signals for error detection. These tools allow the agent to identify likely error locations based on violations of grammatical rules and logical sentence structure, complementing its semantic and phonetic analysis capabilities.

### Beyond Semantics: Using Syntax as an Error Signal

Spoken language is often messy, containing disfluencies, false starts, and grammatical imperfections. However, ASR systems can introduce errors that create a different class of linguistic awkwardness. A mistranscribed word can change a sentence's fundamental grammatical structure, for example, by replacing a noun with a verb or altering subject-verb agreement.⁴ While a powerful LLM has a strong internal model of grammar, it can be beneficial to use specialized, explicit tools that can not only identify that an error exists but can also classify its specific type. This classification provides a more granular signal that can be used to guide the agent's reasoning process. The presence of specific patterns of grammatical anomalies can serve as a high-confidence indicator of an underlying ASR error, prompting a more focused and resource-intensive correction effort.### Tool 9: Grammatical Anomaly Detector

This tool moves beyond a simple "is this grammatical?" check to provide a detailed report on the linguistic health of a sentence. It is based on modern Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems, which are trained to identify and categorize a wide range of grammatical mistakes.

**Functionality**: The tool takes a sentence as input and returns not only a corrected version but also a list of annotations that tag specific errors. These tags can be highly granular, identifying issues such as `VERB_TENSE_MISMATCH`, `SUBJECT_VERB_AGREEMENT`, `INCORRECT_PREPOSITION`, or `MISSING_DETERMINER`.⁸

**Agentic Use Case**: The agent can use this tool as a first-pass diagnostic. Instead of asking the LLM to blindly correct a sentence, it first submits the sentence to the Grammatical Anomaly Detector. The output provides a "map" of potential trouble spots. A high density of error tags within a specific phrase or clause is a strong signal that this part of the sentence may have been corrupted by ASR errors. This allows the agent to focus its more computationally expensive tools (like phonetic analysis or RAG) on these "hotspots." For example, a `SUBJECT_VERB_AGREEMENT` error might point to either the subject or the verb being mistranscribed. The agent can then use the phonetic analyzer on both words to determine which is the more likely source of the error.### Tool 10: Dependency Parsing Verifier

Dependency parsing provides a deep view of a sentence's syntactic structure by mapping the grammatical relationships between words. It constructs a tree where words are nodes and directed arcs represent dependencies, such as a verb's relationship to its subject (`nsubj`) or object (`dobj`).

**Functionality**: This tool takes a sentence as input and returns its dependency parse tree in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CoNLL-U). This output explicitly defines the hierarchy and relationships among all words in the sentence.⁹

**Agentic Use Case**: The agent can use this tool to detect fundamental structural impossibilities that often arise from ASR errors. For example, consider the spoken phrase "the project lead," where "lead" is a noun. If the ASR system erroneously transcribes it as "the project led," where "led" is a verb, the sentence may still seem plausible. However, the dependency parse would reveal a structural anomaly. In the correct version, "lead" would be the object of the determiner "the." In the incorrect version, the parser might fail to create a valid tree or might produce a highly illogical structure, such as a verb being modified by a determiner without a proper clausal structure.

This "syntactic scar tissue"—the downstream structural damage caused by an initial ASR error—is a powerful error signal. The agent can be programmed with heuristics to look for such patterns. For instance, a rule could state: "If the dependency parser returns a tree containing a `DET → VERB` relationship, flag the verb as a highly probable ASR error and initiate phonetic analysis for noun candidates." This allows the agent to build a sophisticated reasoning chain, using the output of the structural analysis tool to trigger and guide the use of the phonetic analysis tool, leading to a highly precise and evidence-based correction. This approach is particularly valuable for adapting parsers trained on written text to the unique challenges of spontaneous speech transcripts.⁹## Orchestration and Synthesis: A Multi-Agent Correction Framework

Having defined a comprehensive suite of scientifically grounded tools, the final step is to architect a system that can orchestrate their use in an intelligent and efficient manner. A single, monolithic agent tasked with managing this diverse and complex toolkit would face significant challenges in terms of prompt complexity, planning, and maintaining a coherent reasoning process. A more robust and scalable solution is a multi-agent system, where a team of specialized agents collaborates to perform ASR error correction. This approach allows for a clear separation of concerns, parallelization of tasks, and the implementation of sophisticated collaborative reasoning patterns, such as debate and review, to arrive at a final transcription of the highest possible quality.

### The Case for a Multi-Agent System

The agentic AI paradigm is increasingly moving towards multi-agent architectures for solving complex problems.¹⁵ Frameworks such as AutoGen and CrewAI are designed to facilitate the collaboration of multiple LLM-powered agents, each with a specific role and set of capabilities.¹⁵ This approach offers several distinct advantages for the task of ASR post-editing:

- **Specialization and Modularity**: The proposed toolkit spans multiple domains of expertise: acoustic analysis, linguistics, and domain-specific knowledge. A multi-agent system allows for the creation of specialist agents, each responsible for a subset of these tools. This simplifies the design of each agent and makes the overall system more modular, maintainable, and extensible.¹⁵

- **Parallelization**: Different types of analysis can be performed concurrently. While one agent is performing phonetic analysis, another can be querying a knowledge graph. This parallel execution can significantly reduce the end-to-end latency of the correction process, which is a critical factor in many applications.

- **Advanced Reasoning through Collaboration**: A multi-agent system enables sophisticated reasoning patterns that are not possible with a single agent. One such pattern is "multi-agent debate," where different agents can propose corrections, provide evidence to support their proposals, and critique the proposals of others. This adversarial or collaborative process forces a more thorough evaluation of hypotheses and leads to more reliable and well-justified corrections.³⁸### Proposed Architecture: The ASR Correction Crew

This report proposes a multi-agent architecture consisting of four distinct, collaborative agents. This structure decomposes the complex correction task into manageable sub-problems, mirroring a team of human experts.

- **Orchestrator Agent**: This agent serves as the project manager. Its primary role is to receive the initial ASR transcript and the full audio file, segment the task, and delegate sub-tasks to the specialist agents. It manages the overall workflow, collects the results from the other agents, and is responsible for the final synthesis of the corrected transcript. It is the main point of contact for the user or the calling application.³⁸

- **Analyst Agent**: This agent is a specialist in signal and structure. It is equipped with the Phonetic Encoder, Signal Quality Assessor, Grammatical Anomaly Detector, and Dependency Parser. When given a transcript segment and its corresponding audio, the Analyst's task is to produce a detailed "analysis report." This report does not propose a correction but instead annotates the segment with potential issues, such as: "Segment SNR is low (12dB). Word 'protocol' has low ASR confidence and is part of a phrase with a SUBJECT_VERB_AGREEMENT anomaly."

- **Knowledge Agent**: This agent is the domain expert. Its tools are the Dynamic Glossary Manager, KG Query Engine, and GEC-RAG. Its role is to provide contextual and factual grounding. Given a segment, it produces a "contextual report" that might include: "The term 'protocol' is not in the session glossary. The alternative 'prototype' is in the glossary with a high boost score. GEC-RAG retrieved 3 examples where the ASR mistook 'prototype' for 'protocol' in a technical context."

- **Refinement Agent**: This agent is the final decision-maker and editor. It receives the original segment, the N-best list, the Analyst Agent's report, and the Knowledge Agent's report. Its task is to synthesize all of this evidence. It weighs the structural and phonetic warnings from the Analyst against the contextual evidence from the Knowledge Agent. If the evidence is overwhelming and points to a clear correction, it uses its Replacement Tool to generate the final text. If the evidence is conflicting, the Refinement Agent can initiate a "debate," sending the conflicting reports back to the Analyst and Knowledge agents with a request for further clarification or justification, before making a final decision.³⁸### The Correction Workflow in Action

Consider the erroneous transcription: "The project led is here."

1. **Orchestrator** receives the segment and dispatches it to the Analyst and Knowledge agents.
2. **Analyst Agent** runs its tools. The Dependency Parser flags an invalid structure (a verb, "led," acting as the subject). The Signal Quality Assessor reports a moderate SNR. The report highlights "led" as a structurally anomalous word.
3. **Knowledge Agent** checks its glossary. It finds that "project lead" is a common term in the business domain of this conversation. Its report states that "lead" (noun) is a contextually probable word in this position.
4. **Refinement Agent** receives both reports. The evidence strongly converges: the Analyst flags a structural error with "led," and the Knowledge agent provides a plausible alternative, "lead." The Refinement Agent then uses the Phonetic Analyzer to confirm that "led" and "lead" are phonetically very similar.
5. With converging evidence from structural, contextual, and phonetic analyses, the Refinement Agent confidently makes the correction: "The project lead is here."

This collaborative process, moving from a single agent with a toolbox to a team of specialists, represents the frontier of agentic AI. It provides a framework for building an ASR post-editing system that is not only powerful but also robust, explainable, and scientifically grounded. To facilitate the implementation of such a system, the following table provides concrete API specifications for the proposed toolkit.| Tool Name | Primary Agent User(s) | Input(s) and Type(s) | Output and Type(s) | Description |

The application of agentic LLMs to Automatic Speech Recognition post-editing represents a significant opportunity to enhance transcription accuracy beyond the capabilities of core ASR systems. However, realizing this potential requires moving beyond simplistic text-based correction workflows. The evidence from a wide body of scientific literature strongly indicates that the most effective and robust solutions are those that can reason about the multi-modal nature of speech and its transcription. ASR errors are not merely textual; they are rooted in acoustic ambiguity, phonetic similarity, linguistic structures, and domain-specific vocabulary.

This report has detailed a blueprint for an advanced agentic framework designed around the principle of "grounded refinement." The proposed system equips an LLM-powered agent, or preferably a collaborative team of agents, with a sophisticated toolkit that provides evidence from multiple modalities. This toolkit includes:

- **Hypothesis Generation Tools** that leverage N-best lists to manage ASR uncertainty and constrain LLM generation, preventing hallucination.
- **Acoustic and Phonetic Tools** that ground the agent's reasoning in the audio signal itself, enabling it to solve errors that are textually invisible.
- **Domain-Knowledge Tools** that infuse the agent with deep, on-the-fly expertise through dynamic glossaries, knowledge graphs, and powerful retrieval-augmented correction techniques.
- **Linguistic Analysis Tools** that use syntactic and grammatical anomalies as high-confidence signals of underlying transcription errors.

By orchestrating these tools within a multi-agent architecture—comprising specialized Analyst, Knowledge, and Refinement agents—the system can decompose the complex correction task, parallelize analysis, and synthesize diverse sources of evidence to produce a final transcript of superior accuracy. This approach transforms the post-editing process from a linear, proofreading task into a dynamic, iterative, and evidence-driven investigation. For developers seeking to build next-generation ASR correction systems, the path forward lies not in simply giving an LLM a larger vocabulary, but in providing it with the instruments to see, hear, and reason about the rich, multi-faceted data from which the transcription originates.
