# Implementation Plan: AI Agent for ASR Transcript Refinement
This plan outlines the key phases and steps to develop your AI agent. We'll prioritize using the ASR system that provides N-best lists, as this offers richer information for error correction.   

## Phase 1: Foundation and Setup
Done.

## Phase 2: LangChain Agent Pipeline - Initial Design

LangChain will orchestrate the core logic. We'll design a chain of components rather than a free-form agent initially, for more predictable behavior.

Input Processing Chain:

Input: Raw audio file/stream.
Step 1 (ASR Tool): A LangChain tool that calls your ASR service (primarily the N-best ASR). There is a SvelteKit endpoint for this already.
Output: 1-best transcript, N-best list, confidence scores.
Step 2 (Initial Formatting): A simple processing step to structure the ASR output for subsequent modules (e.g., segmenting into sentences, associating confidence scores with words).
Error Detection and Candidate Identification Chain:

Input: Formatted ASR output from the previous chain.
Component 1 (Low Confidence Flagging):
Identify words/segments with ASR confidence scores below a configurable threshold. Be mindful that confidence scores alone are not perfectly reliable.   
Component 2 (NLP-based Anomaly Detection - LLM Call):
Use an LLM to analyze semantic coherence. Prompt the LLM to identify awkward phrasing, contextually odd statements, or potential factual inaccuracies in the transcript.   
Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify proper nouns, technical terms, etc.. Flag entities that seem unusual or potentially misspelled.   
Component 3 (N-best List Discrepancy Analysis):
Compare the 1-best hypothesis with other hypotheses in the N-best list. Significant variations can indicate uncertain regions.
Output: A list of "Segments of Interest" (SOIs) with associated reasons for flagging (e.g., low confidence, semantic anomaly, NER issue, N-best variance) and an uncertainty score.
Information Augmentation Controller (Decision Logic):

Input: List of SOIs.
Logic: For each SOI, decide the next step:
High Uncertainty / Factual Query: Trigger Web Search Module.
Moderate Uncertainty / Ambiguity: Prepare for User Dialogue Module (presenting options or asking for clarification).
Low Uncertainty / Likely Simple Fix: Attempt direct LLM correction.
This can be rule-based initially, or a simple LLM call to categorize the SOI.

## Phase 3: Web Search Module (LangChain Tool)

Query Generation:

Input: SOI text and surrounding context.
Method: Use an LLM to generate effective search queries based on the SOI. For potential factual errors, transform the claim into a question. For named entities, use the entity itself, perhaps with phonetic variations if it seems misspelled.   
Consider iterative query refinement if initial results are poor.   
Search Execution:

Integrate with a web search API (e.g., Google Search API, SerpAPI).
Information Processing & Synthesis:

Retrieve top N search results (snippets, links).
Use an LLM to extract relevant information from snippets and synthesize it to support or refute a claim, or provide correct spelling/context for an entity.   
Output: Summarized evidence relevant to the SOI.

## Phase 4: Correction Generation and Application (LangChain Chain)

Correction Candidate Generation (LLM Call):

Input: Original SOI, N-best list for that segment, web search evidence (if any), dialogue history (if any).
Prompting Strategy:
Instruct the LLM to generate a corrected version of the SOI.
Utilize the N-best list by providing it as context, asking the LLM to select the best from the list or generate a new one informed by them.   
Consider constrained decoding techniques if the LLM tends to hallucinate, such as N-best constrained decoding or N-best closest decoding.   
Output: One or more correction candidates with confidence scores (assigned by the LLM or based on heuristics).
Applying Corrections:

If a correction is high-confidence (e.g., from direct user input or a very certain LLM fix), apply it to the working transcript.
Maintain an audit trail of changes.

## Phase 5: SvelteKit Frontend and User Dialogue Module

Transcript Display:

Develop Svelte components to display the ASR transcript.
Visually highlight SOIs identified by the backend. Use subtle highlighting to avoid overwhelming the user, given the limitations of confidence-based highlighting.   
Allow users to play corresponding audio segments.
Interaction Mechanisms (Human-in-the-Loop):

Selection & Direct Edit: Users can select any part of the transcript and type corrections.
System-Initiated Dialogue:
When the backend flags an SOI for user interaction, the frontend should present this.
Clarification Questions: "Did you say X or Y?".   
Option Presentation: If the LLM generated multiple correction candidates, or if N-best hypotheses are relevant, present these as choices.   
Confirmation Seeking: "The system suggests changing A to B. Is this correct?"
Implement API endpoints in your SvelteKit backend (or separate backend) to handle these interactions. These endpoints will communicate with the LangChain pipeline.
Dialogue Management (Backend - LangChain):

Maintain dialogue state (e.g., current SOI being discussed, questions asked).
The LLM can generate system utterances for the dialogue based on the dialogue state and the type of clarification needed.   
Process user responses (text input, button clicks for choices/confirmations) from the SvelteKit frontend.

## Phase 6: Iterative Refinement Loop and Workflow Management

Overall Control Flow:

User uploads/records audio.
Initial ASR transcription and error detection pass.
The system processes SOIs one by one or in batches, deciding whether to use web search, LLM correction, or user dialogue.
User interacts via SvelteKit UI to confirm, correct, or clarify.
Corrections are applied.
The system can then re-analyze the corrected segment or the entire transcript for new potential errors or to see if previous corrections resolved downstream issues. This forms the iterative loop.   
Session Management:

Store the state of the transcript and the refinement process for each user session.
Stopping Conditions:

User manually finalizes the transcript.
No more SOIs are identified above a certain threshold.
A maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Phase 7: Testing, Deployment, and Future Considerations

Testing:

Unit tests for individual modules (ASR wrapper, search tool, LLM prompts).
Integration tests for the LangChain pipeline.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with the SvelteKit interface to evaluate usability and effectiveness.
Evaluate using metrics like WER reduction, task completion time, and user satisfaction. For proper nouns, consider Jaro-Winkler distance.   
Deployment:

Deploy the SvelteKit frontend.
Deploy the backend (containing LangChain agent) (e.g., Docker container on a cloud platform like Google Cloud, AWS, Azure).
Future Enhancements (from previous research report):

Continuous Learning: Implement mechanisms to learn from user corrections to improve the agent's error detection and suggestion capabilities over time (e.g., fine-tuning a smaller model on correction pairs, RLHF).   
Personalization: User-specific profiles for vocabulary and common errors.
Advanced Ambiguity Handling: More sophisticated probabilistic frameworks.
Explainability: Provide users with reasons for suggested changes.   
LangChain Specifics:

Chains: Use SequentialChain or custom chains to link steps like ASR -> Error Detection -> Correction Suggestion.
Tools: Wrap ASR, Web Search, and potentially specific NLP analysis functions as LangChain Tools that an LLM-driven chain or agent can invoke.
LLMs: Integrate your chosen LLM (e.g., ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic) for generation and reasoning tasks.
Prompt Templates: Extensively use PromptTemplate to structure inputs to the LLM for different tasks (error detection, query generation, correction, dialogue).
Output Parsers: Define how to parse LLM outputs (e.g., lists of SOIs, correction candidates).
