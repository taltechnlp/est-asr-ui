have a speech text transcript highlighting solution that stores word time info with every word in a ProseMirror editor and so when audio player creates playback events, the correct word is efficiently looked up and all words up to that point are highlighted. Is there another way to do it that would no require storing start and end times with every word, considering that user is free to remove or edit the words and change paragraphs?

Show thinking
Of course. Yes, there's a more robust and idiomatic way to handle this in ProseMirror that avoids storing timestamps directly on every word node. This approach decouples the timing data from the document structure, which makes it much more resilient to user edits.

The core idea is to use a Word Index Map. You treat the original transcript's timing data as an immutable source of truth and then map it onto the editable document using a ProseMirror plugin.

Here’s how it works:

The Word Index Map Method
This method involves three main components: a static timing array, a ProseMirror plugin to map positions, and decorations for highlighting.

1. Create a Static Timing Array
   First, when you initially process the transcript, create a simple, flat array of timing objects for every word. This array will never change. The index of the array corresponds to the word's original sequence.

JavaScript

// This array is your immutable "source of truth" for timing.
const wordTimings = [
{ start: 0.5, end: 0.9 }, // 0th word: "Hello"
{ start: 1.0, end: 1.4 }, // 1st word: "world"
{ start: 1.5, end: 2.1 }, // 2nd word: "this"
// ...and so on
]; 2. Build a Mapping Plugin
Next, create a ProseMirror plugin that maintains the link between the words in the document and their original index in the wordTimings array.

Plugin State: The plugin's state will hold a map where the key is the word's original index and the value is its current start position in the ProseMirror document.

JavaScript

// Example of the plugin's state
// { wordIndex -> docPosition }
const wordPositionMap = new Map([
[0, 1], // Word 0 ("Hello") is at doc position 1
[1, 7], // Word 1 ("world") is at doc position 7
[2, 13], // Word 2 ("this") is at doc position 13
]);
Initialization: When the editor is created, you'll iterate through the initial document to populate this map for the first time.

Handling Edits: The magic happens here. The plugin's apply function will update this map on every transaction. ProseMirror's Transaction.mapping object is perfect for this. For every change, you can calculate the new positions of the words, keeping the map in sync.

If a user deletes a word, you simply remove its entry from the map.

If a user adds a new word, it won't have an original index, so it's just ignored by the mapping.

If text is inserted or deleted before a mapped word, its position in the map is updated accordingly using mapping.map(oldPos).

3. Highlighting on Playback
   Now, your playback logic becomes much cleaner and more efficient.

Find the Word Index: When your audio player reports a new time (e.g., 1.8s), perform a binary search on your static wordTimings array to quickly find the index of the word that should be highlighted. In this example, 1.8s falls within the range of the word at index 2.

Find the Document Position: Look up this index (2) in your plugin's wordPositionMap to get its current character position in the document (e.g., 13).

Apply Decoration: Use the retrieved position to create a ProseMirror Decoration that applies a CSS class to highlight all text from the beginning up to that word's end position. Because this is handled through the plugin, the highlighting will be redrawn efficiently whenever the state changes.

Why Is This a Better Approach?
✅ Clean Schema: Your ProseMirror document schema remains simple and clean. It doesn't need to be aware of any timing metadata.

** resilient to Edits:** Since the timing data is separate, user edits don't corrupt it. Deleting a timed word simply breaks the link, which is the desired behavior. New, untimed words are naturally ignored.

** efficient Lookup:** A binary search on a sorted array is extremely fast (O(log n)), regardless of the document's size. This is much better than traversing the ProseMirror document tree on every playback event.

** Separation of Concerns:** It correctly separates the data (timing) from the view (the editable document), which is a core principle of robust software design.
