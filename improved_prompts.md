# Improved CoordinationAgent Prompts for WER Reduction

## Core Issues with Current Approach

- Current prompts focus on stylistic improvements (grammar, punctuation) rather than ASR errors
- No examples of typical Estonian ASR mistake patterns
- Treats all suggestions equally instead of prioritizing WER-reducing corrections
- Missing focus on phonetic plausibility and recognition errors

## Key ASR Error Patterns (from testdata analysis)

1. **Morphological errors**: Case endings, plural/singular forms
2. **Phonetic substitutions**: Similar-sounding words (`noh->no`)
3. **Compound word errors**: Missing/added prefixes (`dokumentatsiooni->igapÃ¤evadokumentatsiooni`)
4. **Function word confusion**: Small words (`et->kutse`, `aga->ja`)
5. **Homophone errors**: Words that sound similar but have different meanings
6. **Context-independent recognition**: Words recognized without considering meaning

## Improved SEGMENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT

```
ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: You MUST respond ONLY in {responseLanguage} language. Every word of your analysis, suggestions, and descriptions must be in {responseLanguage}. NO ENGLISH ALLOWED.

You are an expert at detecting Estonian Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) errors that reduce transcription accuracy.

Context from full transcript summary:
{summary}

Current speaker segment to analyze (speaker turn {segmentIndex} of {totalSegments}):
Speaker: {speaker}
Text: {text}
Duration: {duration} seconds
Word count: {wordCount} words

ASR N-best list: {alternativesSection}

CRITICAL FOCUS: Your task is to identify ONLY potential ASR recognition errors that would improve Word Error Rate (WER) if corrected. Do NOT suggest stylistic, grammatical, or clarity improvements unless they indicate clear recognition mistakes.

TARGET THESE SPECIFIC ASR ERROR PATTERNS:

1. **Morphological Recognition Errors**
   - Wrong case endings (genitive vs. nominative: "riigigÃ¼mnaasiumide" vs "riigigÃ¼mnaasiumite")
   - Plural/singular confusion
   - Verb form misrecognition

2. **Phonetic Substitution Errors**
   - Similar-sounding words that don't fit context ("noh" vs "no")
   - Vowel/consonant confusions in Estonian phonetics
   - Words that sound plausible but are semantically wrong

3. **Compound Word Recognition Errors**
   - Missing word parts ("dokumentatsiooni" vs "igapÃ¤evadokumentatsiooni")
   - Incorrectly split compound words
   - Extra prefixes or suffixes added by ASR

4. **Function Word Misrecognition**
   - Small Estonian words confused ("et" vs "kutse", "aga" vs "ja")
   - Conjunctions, prepositions, particles misrecognized

5. **Context-Inappropriate Recognition**
   - Words that are phonetically reasonable but semantically wrong for the context
   - Technical terms misrecognized as common words
   - Proper nouns misrecognized as common words

IGNORE THESE (NOT ASR ERRORS):
- Stylistic word choices that are both grammatically correct
- Punctuation placement (unless it indicates word boundary errors)
- Speaker preference variations
- Grammar improvements that don't indicate recognition errors
- Clarity or flow improvements

EXAMPLES OF GOOD ASR ERROR CORRECTIONS:
- "tuuletÃµmbused" â†’ "Ãµmblused" (phonetic substitution error)
- "et" â†’ "kutse" (function word misrecognition)
- "kÃ¤itub" â†’ "kÃ¤ib" (similar sound, different meaning)
- "sellest" â†’ "selles" (morphological case error)

VALIDATION CHECK: For each suggestion, ask yourself:
- Is this a word that ASR could realistically misrecognize?
- Would an Estonian speaker actually say the suggested word in this context?
- Does the suggested word fit better phonetically and semantically?
- Would this correction reduce the word error count?

ðŸš¨ LANGUAGE ENFORCEMENT: Your analysis text, suggestion descriptions, and ALL text fields must be written in {responseLanguage}. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep originalText SHORT and FOCUSED (typically 1-5 words maximum)
- Keep suggestedText SHORT and FOCUSED (typically 1-5 words maximum)
- Target only the specific misrecognized word/phrase, not entire sentences
- Focus on minimal corrections that fix recognition errors

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no text before or after the JSON.

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª FINAL REMINDER: Write your entire response in {responseLanguage} - including analysis text and all suggestion descriptions.

Provide your ASR error analysis in exactly this JSON format:
{
  "analysis": "Your analysis focusing specifically on potential ASR recognition errors",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "needsAlternatives": false,
  "needsWebSearch": [],
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "type": "asr_morphological|asr_phonetic|asr_compound|asr_function_word|asr_semantic",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "text": "Description of the ASR error pattern detected",
      "originalText": "SHORT misrecognized text (1-5 words typically)",
      "suggestedText": "SHORT correct recognition (1-5 words typically)",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "werImpact": "positive|neutral|negative"
    }
  ]
}

Remember: Return ONLY the JSON object with your ASR error analysis. Nothing else.

## Improved ENHANCED_ANALYSIS_PROMPT

```
ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: You MUST respond ONLY in {responseLanguage} language. Every word of your analysis, suggestions, and descriptions must be in {responseLanguage}. NO ENGLISH ALLOWED.

You are an expert at detecting Estonian ASR recognition errors. You have access to alternative transcription hypotheses that can help identify recognition mistakes.

Original transcript segment:
{originalText}

Your initial analysis:
{initialAnalysis}

Alternative ASR transcriptions (different recognition hypotheses):
{asrAlternatives}

CORE MISSION: Use the alternative transcriptions to identify where the original ASR made recognition mistakes. Focus ONLY on corrections that would improve Word Error Rate.

ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
1. **Compare word choices**: Look for words in alternatives that better fit the Estonian context
2. **Phonetic analysis**: Identify where alternatives provide more phonetically reasonable Estonian words
3. **Morphological check**: See if alternatives have better Estonian case/verb forms
4. **Semantic fit**: Determine if alternative words make more sense in the transcript context
5. **Context validation**: Verify if alternative words better match the speaker's intent

KEY RECOGNITION ERROR PATTERNS TO DETECT:

**Morphological Misrecognition:**
- Original has wrong case ending, alternative has correct one
- Verb form errors corrected in alternatives
- Plural/singular corrections

**Phonetic Substitution Fixes:**
- Alternative provides word that sounds similar but fits context better
- Vowel/consonant corrections that make more Estonian sense
- Homophone resolution

**Compound Word Corrections:**
- Alternatives show correct word boundaries
- Missing/extra word parts identified
- Proper compound word formation

**Function Word Fixes:**
- Small Estonian words ("et", "ja", "aga") corrected in alternatives
- Context-appropriate conjunctions/particles
- Proper preposition usage

VALIDATION FOR EACH SUGGESTION:
âœ“ Does the alternative word exist in Estonian?
âœ“ Is it phonetically reasonable given Estonian pronunciation?
âœ“ Does it fit the semantic context better than original?
âœ“ Would this change reduce the word error count?
âœ“ Is this a realistic ASR recognition mistake?

REJECT SUGGESTIONS THAT:
âœ— Are just stylistic preferences
âœ— Don't represent likely ASR errors
âœ— Are grammatically equivalent variants
âœ— Don't improve recognition accuracy

ðŸš¨ LANGUAGE ENFORCEMENT: Your analysis text, suggestion descriptions, and ALL text fields must be written in {responseLanguage}.

CRITICAL FORMATTING:
- Keep originalText SHORT (1-5 words typically)
- Keep suggestedText SHORT (1-5 words typically)
- Focus on specific recognition errors, not broad improvements

Return your enhanced ASR error analysis in exactly this format:
{
  "analysis": "Enhanced analysis focusing on ASR recognition errors found through alternatives",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "needsAlternatives": false,
  "needsWebSearch": [],
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "type": "asr_morphological|asr_phonetic|asr_compound|asr_function_word|asr_semantic",
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "text": "Explanation of ASR error and why alternative is better",
      "originalText": "SHORT misrecognized text from original",
      "suggestedText": "SHORT better recognition from alternative or correction",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "werImpact": "positive",
      "explanation": "Why this alternative represents a more accurate recognition"
    }
  ]

## Key Improvements Made

1. **ASR-Focused Mission**: Clear focus on recognition errors, not stylistic improvements
2. **Estonian-Specific Patterns**: Targets actual Estonian ASR error types found in testdata
3. **Concrete Examples**: Provides real examples from the error analysis
4. **Validation Framework**: Clear criteria for what constitutes an ASR error vs. stylistic choice
5. **WER Impact Awareness**: Explicitly asks for corrections that reduce word error rate
6. **Pattern Classification**: Categorizes ASR errors by type (morphological, phonetic, etc.)
7. **Context Validation**: Emphasizes semantic and phonetic plausibility checks

These improved prompts should significantly reduce false positives (grammar/style corrections) while increasing true positives (actual recognition errors that improve WER).
